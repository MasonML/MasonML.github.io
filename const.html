            <details open>
        <summary><h4>Article II - Purpose of Organization</h4></summary>
        <p>MML  aims  to  provide  a  forum  for  collaborative  learning  and  software  development  in  machine  learning. Our goal is to significantly enrich the experiences of students through our work on Artificial Intelligence.</p>        
            </details>
              <details open>
        <summary><h4>Article III - Membership</h4></summary>
              <p>Membership in this organization will not be restricted on the basis of race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, gender identity, species, gender expression, sex, or age.</p>
              <p>Membership is open to all currently enrolled GMU students in good academic standing with the university with a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 who support the advancement of the organization’s principles.</p>
              <p>MML attendees will be classified as a <b>member</b>, <b>developer</b>, or <b>researcher</b>. In this document, the term “general membership” shall refer to the combined body of members, developers, and researchers. The term “esteemed membership” shall refer to the combined body of developers and researchers.</p>
              <h5>Members</h5>
              <p>Members are individuals interested in participating in the MML community. All new attendees of MML are initially considered members. Members may not participate in official votes, nor will the have access to Executive Board positions. They may contribute to MML development and research projects under the guidance and supervision of an Executive Board member or a project lead.</p>
              <h5>Developers</h5>
              <p>Developers are individuals invested in the MML community. These members have full voting rights and may request project leadership positions. A project leadership position entails access to MML infrastructure as required by their project, and as overseen by the VP of Projects. Additionally, project leadership entails the responsibility to maintain project documentation and oversee project development. Developers may also contribute to MML projects under the guidance and supervision of a project lead. To attain developer status, a member must demonstrate leadership skills, commitment to MML principles, and technical ability. Prospective developers will be selected based on these qualifications by official vote.</p>
              <p>Any prospective developer will not be voted on more than twice per semester. Any developer who leaves the university, whether by graduating or otherwise, loses their developer status. Developers who graduate automatically become alumni members. Developers who leave the university without graduating do not automatically gain alumni status, but may request alumni status from the Executive Board, who will decide the matter by a majority vote. Developers who are expelled lose their developer status and may not request alumni status.</p>
              <h6>Becoming a Developer</h6>
              <p>To attain developer status, a member must demonstrate leadership skills, commitment to MML principles, and technical ability. To become a developer, a member (hereafter referred to as a “nominee”) should notify the Executive Board of their desire to become a developer and present a justification for gaining developer status. This justification should include a brief history of the nominee’s contributions to the organization. Alternatively, a developer may nominate a member to the Executive Board and provide a similar rationale.</p>
              <p>The Executive Board will review the rationale and vote on whether to admit the nominee. If the Executive Board votes against admitting the developer, then the developer body (including the members of the Executive Board) shall be provided with the nominee’s rationale and will have their own chance to vote, conducted according to the rules of an official vote. If the developers vote to admit the nominee, they shall be admitted without prejudice. If the developers vote to not admit the nominee, then the nominee shall not be given developer status, but may re-apply in the future.</p>
              <p>No nominee may be voted on more than twice in one semester.</p>
              <h6>Developer Selection Criteria</h6>
              <p>To be accepted as a developer, an individual must meet three of the following four criteria, with emphasis on the first two.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>MATH 203, CS 310; B or higher.</li>
                  <li>Active contributions to MML development projects.</li>
                  <li>Active leadership participation in MML community events.</li>
                  <li>Active social participation in the MML community, including meeting or event attendance.</li>
             </ul>
            <p>Course requirements may be waved if a sufficient level of competency in linear algebra, statistics, and algorithms is demonstrated.</p>
              <h5>Researchers</h5>
                <p>Researchers are individuals invested in the MML community. These members have full voting rights and may request research leadership positions. A research leadership position entails access to MML infrastructure as required by their research, and as overseen by the VP of Research. Additionally, research leadership entails the responsibility to maintain research documentation and oversee research development. Researchers may also contribute to MML research under the guidance and supervision of a research lead. To attain researcher status, a member must demonstrate leadership skills, commitment to MML principles, and technical ability. Prospective researchers will be selected based on these qualifications by official vote.</p>
                <p>Any prospective researcher will not be voted on more than twice per semester. Any researcher who leaves the university, whether by graduating or otherwise, loses their researcher status. Researchers who graduate automatically become alumni members. Developers who leave the university without graduating do not automatically gain alumni status, but may request alumni status from the Executive Board, who will decide the matter by a majority vote. Researchers who are expelled lose their researcher status and may not request alumni status.</p>

              <h5>Revocation of Membership</h5>
              <p>In extraordinary circumstances, if a motion is brought and seconded at a meeting for revocation of a esteemed member's status, the MML general membership will be notified by email of the motion not less than five days before the following meeting. If a quorum of esteemed members is present, an official vote will be held by secret ballot, requiring a $\frac{3}{4}$ of the esteemed membership. Although an official vote, all present members will be allowed to present arguments for or against revocation of the esteemed member's status prior to the vote.</p>
              <p>Developer status will be automatically removed if suspended or expelled by the university.</p>
